# Ingestion

### Cloud IoT
- A fully managed service to easily and securely connect, manage, and ingest data from globally dispersed devices.
- A complete solution for collecting, processing, analyzing and visualizing IoT data in real time to support improved operational efficiency.

### Cloud Function
- Scalable pay as you use functions as a service ( `FaaS` ) to run your code with zero server management.
- No servers to provision, manage, or upgrade.
- Automatically scale based on the load.
- Integrated monitoring, logging, and debugging capability.
- Built-in security at role and per function level based on the principle of least privilege.
- Key networking capabilities for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.

### Pub Sub
- A fully managed real time messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages between independent applications.

# Data Lake 

### Cloud Storage 
- Object storage for companies of all sizes. 
- Store any amount of data. 
- Retrieve it as often as youâ€™d like.
- Worldwide accessibility and worldwide storage locations.
- Low latency and high durability.

# Preparation and Computation

### Data Proc

### Appendix 

1. `Dispersed` 
- Spread over a wide area.

2. `MQTT` 
- Message Queuing Telementry Transport, light weight, publish subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices.

3. `Provision`
- Action of providing or supplying something for use.
